"Okay. So currently for each uh league in each season season meaning year, uh, there is a manual scheduling once a year. Okay. It's done manually, uh, maybe without taking into um consideration many constraints. Okay. Uh, so what I would like the system to have, is to have the ability to define policy of how to schedule games. For example, a common policy is that each game, it's uh, a pair of teams they too can sale, once in the in team A stadium and once in team B stadium, this is a common practice. So there was a need to determine the this kind of policy. Maybe we'll like to have a minimal uh, time between matches among the same pair. Uh, maybe it would like to say, uh set the date for uh, the day in the week in which the competition will take place, and many other things that regarding that policy. So this kind of constraints should be taken into account when executing the the scheduling algorithm.

"Okay. So in my view, the currently this is done also manually. The administer calls the referee. Can you uh can you participate in that game? And that's how the scheduling is happening and the enforcement of this policy, again, it's done manually. So for uh for the referee as well, the system should be uh should have some kind of uh guidance of how to allocate referees to games. For example, we wouldn't like the same refereee to participate in the game and two games of the same teams. Okay. Okay. Uh this yeah, for another example is that we would like to all referees to participate in the same number of games.? Okay,
","['1. The system must provide guidance on how to allocate referees to games.', '2. The system must ensure that the same referee does not participate in the same number of games for two teams.']"
"So I would like the system to be able to uh facilitate the definition of such policy and then based on that policy to assign the referee to the games, it might be also that the system will enable the referees to install their preferences. Okay. For example, since I planned already my vacation for the next year, I cannot participate in these days. So when scheduling it will take these constraints as well. 
","['1. The system must allow users to define and save policy for assigning referees to games.', '2. The system must take into account user preferences, such as vacation schedules, when assigning referees to games.']"
"Okay. And of course now, because it's done manually, we cannot accommodate such requests. 
","['1. The system must have the ability to accommodate manual requests.', '2. The system must have a mechanism in place to handle and process requests that cannot be accommodated manually.']"
"No no no. Once you are scheduled for a season, it's done. Okay. It cannot be changed unless there's one um, it might be reduced to certain circumstances. The game is canceled. The weather, Uh, something happened within the city area and things like that. So in that sense, we need to reschedule the game. So in that sense, in that case we need to allow manual adjustment of the schedule.

",['1. The system must have a manual adjustment feature.']
"Yeah. So uh if I understand this correctly in the scheduling system or software that we will build um there at the very best level there exists a team of schedulers who look into the teams and then they schedule the games and then on top of it there, as I say, a master scheduler who approves this scheduling and in in case of weather changes that he he can manually change the scheduling and on top of the master scheduler a is an IFA Admin or team of admins who can again overlook and if they want to change it, they can explicitly say that. Why do they want to change the existing scheduling? ? No there is only one level. The automatic scheduling and override by the IFA representative. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah just one level.

"Just I have one more question. Sorry. About the scheduling. Uh Is that a number of days gap for example I am team A and he's team B. And uh suppose we played a match together. Now we have a minimum we should have two days of gap before playing the next game or one day of gap before playing the next game.
","['1. The system must have a feature to track and display the gap between matches for teams A and B.', '2. The system must have a feature to set and manage the minimum gap between matches for teams A and B.']"

",['1. The system must have a parameter definition feature.']
"So currently any information the fans would like nowadays, they need to pull the information. Yeah. You need to look for it. If you can change is the schedule. They need to look for it. Uh If a player post a message, you should look for it and things like that. Our view in the new systems, we would like the fan to get information from the system in a push mail. So for example, if he's interested in a, in a certain game Barcelona versus Real Madrid. Uh, so we would register to that game and you would get notifications, notifications regarding that game. For example, if the game of if the schedule is changed would get notification.

"So yeah, so this is uh, somewhat in line with what we thought of again, to build a very nice fan portal there, the teams can have their own pages, the players can have their own separate profiles or pages and then fans can follow those pages and uh comment or our pictures and um something, something like that, correct? ?

Uh Do we also need uh some email notifications or some direct messages?? No. No. I'll prefer that everything would be in the application of the website.
